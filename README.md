# Honeydoo
Angularfire app to save your relationship

Honeydoo is a side project I created in an effort to learn Angular v1 and also also learn and implement firebase in a side project.
A special thank you to my better half for suggesting the project.

Honeydoo allows you to connect with and share a complex todo list with your significant other. The project is currently a work in progess, 
but feel free to create an account and test if you like. If you find any bugs or would like to see new features/feature enhancements, please
create an issue and I will look into it as soon as I can.

##### Built with:
1.  Angular v1.4.8
2.  Angularfire v1.1.3
3.  Bootstrap v3.3.5
4.  Jade
