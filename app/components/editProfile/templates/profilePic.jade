          p An "avatar" is an image that represents you onlineâ€”a little picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites.
          p A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar. You upload it and create your profile just once, and then when you participate in any Gravatar-enabled site your Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.
          p Gravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users. It is automatically included in every WordPress.com account and is run and supported by Automattic.
          p Remember to use the same email address when you sign up with Gravatar. Your profile pic will appear as soon as you save an image
